Kate
She had something to tell me, I knew it.  That she'd been so helpful and good-natured all day told me it was probably something bad.  
Or she was going to ask me to take her somewhere.  Or buy her something.  Or let her go somewhere I wouldn't approve of.
My brilliant girl, the one everyone goes out of their way to brag to me about.  Her kindness, her maturity, her intelligence.  
What they don't see, what no one sees, is how she drives me crazy with her willfullness, her chutzpah.  My little attorney, debating and arguing just for the fun of it.  

My future astronaut.  Or will she be a rabbi's wife?  Or will she start that little farm she talks about?  Or do all of it or something else.  
I dedcided not to wonder about why she was so exceedingly pleasant all day.  Helping with the Littles, making dinner, asking about my day.  Hmmm.  
Better to enjoy the moment.
Now she'd asked to have a "DMC."  No point speculating.
Littles finally in bed.  Here she comes into my office with a nervous smile.  "Ok, so.  Well, first, tell me about your day."
"Chaya, I don't want to play games.  If you have something to say, please get to it."
She's thinking.  I'm waiting.  What's the worst thing it could be?  
"Ok, so, before I tell you, you have to promise not to yell.  Because I really want to tell you because it's really great and I've been dying to tell you, 
but you just.can't.yell."
"I'm listening."  Speculation without data is folly.  Who said that?  Holmes?  That's something he'd say.  
Ok, deep breath.  Get ready for it.  These are the "Mom Moments," the ones that have way more to do with how I handle them than what actually happens.  
I try to channel my Grandma.  Please, please let her voice and words come out and not my own mother's.  Just don't let me be my mother right now.
"I met a boy.
